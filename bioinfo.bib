  abstract = {Motivation: A major challenge of systems biology is to infer biochemical
	interactions from large-scale observations, such as transcriptomics,

	between direct and indirect interactions of biochemical compounds,
	thereby inferring the underlying network topology. Results: The method
	is first thoroughly evaluated with a large set of simulated data.
	Results indicate that the approach has good statistical power and
	a low False Discovery Rate even in the presence of noise in the data.
	We then applied the method to an existing data set of yeast gene
	expression. Several small gene networks were inferred and found to
	contain genes known to be collectively involved in particular biochemical
	processes. In some of these networks there are also uncharacterized
	ORFs present, which lead to hypotheses about their functions. Availability:

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic networks are often described statistically using
	graphical models (e.g. Bayesian networks). However, inferring the
	network structure offers a serious challenge in microarray analysis
	where the sample size is small compared to the number of considered
	genes. This renders many standard algorithms for graphical models
	inapplicable, and inferring genetic networks an 'ill-posed' inverse
	problem. METHODS: We introduce a novel framework for small-sample
	inference of graphical models from gene expression data. Specifically,
	we focus on the so-called graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) that are
	now frequently used to describe gene association networks and to
	detect conditionally dependent genes. Our new approach is based on
	(1) improved (regularized) small-sample point estimates of partial
	correlation, (2) an exact test of edge inclusion with adaptive estimation
	of the degree of freedom and (3) a heuristic network search based
	on false discovery rate multiple testing. Steps (2) and (3) correspond
	to an empirical Bayes estimate of the network topology. RESULTS:
	Using computer simulations, we investigate the sensitivity (power)
	and specificity (true negative rate) of the proposed framework to
	estimate GGMs from microarray data. This shows that it is possible
	to recover the true network topology with high accuracy even for
	small-sample datasets. Subsequently, we analyze gene expression data
	from a breast cancer tumor study and illustrate our approach by inferring
	a corresponding large-scale gene association network for 3883 genes.

	relevance.RESULTS:We applied various clustering algorithms to microarray
	datasets with different sizes, and we evaluated the clustering results
	by determining the fraction of gene pairs from the same clusters
	that share at least one known common transcription factor. We used
	both yeast transcription factor databases (SCPD, YPD) and chromatin
	immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data to evaluate our clustering results.
	We showed that the ability to identify co-regulated genes from clustering
	results is strongly dependent on the number of microarray experiments
	used in cluster analysis and the accuracy of these associations plateaus
	at between 50 and 100 experiments on yeast data. Moreover, the model-based
	clustering algorithm MCLUST consistently outperforms more traditional
	methods in accurately assigning co-regulated genes to the same clusters
	on standardized data.CONCLUSIONS:Our results are consistent with
	respect to independent evaluation criteria that strengthen our confidence
	in our results. However, when one compares ChIP data to YPD, the
	false-negative rate is approximately 80% using the recommended p-value
	of 0.001. In addition, we showed that even with large numbers of

abstract = {Motivation: In recent years, there have been various efforts to overcome the limitations of standard clustering approaches for the analysis of gene expression data by grouping genes and samples simultaneously. The underlying concept, which is often referred to as biclustering, allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns across subsets of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated for different organisms and datasets. Several biclustering methods have been proposed in the literature; however, it is not clear how the different techniques compare with each other with respect to the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics such as robustness and sensitivity to noise. Accordingly, no guidelines concerning the choice of the biclustering method are currently available.  Results: First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and validating biclustering methods that includes a simple binary reference model. Although this model captures the essential features of most biclustering approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine all optimal groupings; to this end, we propose a fast divide-and-conquer algorithm (Bimax). Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient biclustering algorithms together with the reference model and a hierarchical clustering method on various synthetic and real datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The comparison reveals that (1) biclustering in general has advantages over a conventional hierarchical clustering approach, (2) there are considerable performance differences between the tested methods and (3) already the simple reference model delivers relevant patterns within all considered settings.

RESULTS: This paper describes a computational framework for integrating and drawing inferences from a collection of genome-wide measurements. Each dataset is represented via a kernel function, which defines generalized similarity relationships between pairs of entities, such as genes or proteins. The kernel representation is both flexible and efficient, and can be applied to many different types of data. Furthermore, kernel functions derived from different types of data can be combined in a straightforward fashion. Recent advances in the theory of kernel methods have provided efficient algorithms to perform such combinations in a way that minimizes a statistical loss function. These methods exploit semidefinite programming techniques to reduce the problem of finding optimizing kernel combinations to a convex optimization problem. Computational experiments performed using yeast genome-wide datasets, including amino acid sequences, hydropathy profiles, gene expression data and known protein-protein interactions, demonstrate the utility of this approach. A statistical learning algorithm trained from all of these data to recognize particular classes of proteins--membrane proteins and ribosomal proteins--performs significantly better than the same algorithm trained on any single type of data.

@article{jong02modeling,
	abstract = {In order to understand the functioning of organisms on the molecular level, we need to know which genes are expressed, when and where in the organism, and to which extent. The regulation of gene expression is achieved through genetic regulatory systems structured by networks of interactions between DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. As most genetic regulatory networks of interest involve many components connected through interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, an intuitive understanding of their dynamics is hard to obtain. As a consequence, formal methods and computer tools for the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks will be indispensable. This paper reviews formalisms that have been employed in mathematical biology and bioinformatics to describe genetic regulatory systems, in particular directed graphs, Bayesian networks, Boolean networks and their generalizations, ordinary and partial differential equations, qualitative differential equations, stochastic equations, and rule-based formalisms. In addition, the paper discusses how these formalisms have been used in the simulation of the behavior of actual regulatory systems.},

	abstract = {We explored genomic expression patterns in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae responding to diverse environmental transitions. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in transcript levels over time for almost every yeast gene, as cells responded to temperature shocks, hydrogen peroxide, the superoxide-generating drug menadione, the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, amino acid starvation, nitrogen source depletion, and progression into stationary phase. A large set of genes (approximately 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

abstract = {We studied the physiological response to limitation by diverse nutrients in batch and steady-state (chemostat) cultures of S. cerevisiae. We found that the global pattern of transcription in steady-state cultures in limiting phosphate or sulfate is essentially identical to that of batch cultures growing in the same medium just before the limiting nutrient is completely exhausted. The massive stress response and complete arrest of the cell cycle that occurs when nutrients are fully exhausted in batch cultures is not observed in the chemostat, indicating that the cells in the chemostat are "poor, not starving." Similar comparisons using leucine or uracil auxotrophs limited on leucine or uracil again showed patterns of gene expression in steady-state closely resembling those of corresponding batch cultures just before they exhaust the nutrient. Although there is also a strong stress response in the auxotrophic batch cultures, cell cycle arrest, if it occurs at all, is much less uniform. Many of the differences among the patterns of gene expression between the four nutrient limitations are interpretable in light of known involvement of the genes in stress responses or in the regulation or execution of particular metabolic pathways appropriate to the limiting nutrient. We conclude that cells adjust their growth rate to nutrient availability and maintain homeostasis in the same way in batch and steady state conditions; cells in steady-state cultures are in a physiological condition normally encountered in batch cultures.

  abstract = {Motivation: {B}ayesian networks have been applied to infer genetic
	regulatory interactions from microarray gene expression data. This
	inference problem is particularly hard in that interactions between
	hundreds of genes have to be learned from very small data sets, typically
	containing only a few dozen time points during a cell cycle. Most
	previous studies have assessed the inference results on real gene
	expression data by comparing predicted genetic regulatory interactions
	with those known from the biological literature. This approach is
	controversial due to the absence of known gold standards, which renders
	the estimation of the sensitivity and specificity, that is, the true
	and (complementary) false detection rate, unreliable and difficult.
	The objective of the present study is to test the viability of the
	{B}ayesian network paradigm in a realistic simulation study. First,
	gene expression data are simulated from a realistic biological network
	involving DNAs, mRNAs, inactive protein monomers and active protein
	dimers. Then, interaction networks are inferred from these data in
	a reverse engineering approach, using {B}ayesian networks and {B}ayesian
	learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Results: The simulation results
	are presented as receiver operator characteristics curves. This allows
	estimating the proportion of spurious gene interactions incurred
	for a specified target proportion of recovered true interactions.
	The findings demonstrate how the network inference performance varies
	with the training set size, the degree of inadequacy of prior assumptions,
	the experimental sampling strategy and the inclusion of further,
	sequence-based information. Availability: The programs and data used

A major challenge is to identify characteristic patterns in this network of interactions that may shed light on basic cellular mechanisms. Previous studies have analyzed aspects of this network, concentrating on either transcription-regulation or protein-protein interactions. Here we search for composite network motifs: characteristic network patterns consisting of both transcription-regulation and protein-protein interactions that recur significantly more often than in random networks. To this end we developed algorithms for detecting motifs in networks with two or more types of interactions and applied them to an integrated data set of protein-protein interactions and transcription regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found a two-protein mixed-feedback loop motif, five types of three-protein motifs exhibiting coregulation and complex formation, and many motifs involving four proteins. Virtually all four-protein motifs consisted of combinations of smaller motifs. This study presents a basic framework for detecting the building blocks of networks with multiple types of interactions.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Signaling pathways are dynamic events that take place
	over a given period of time. In order to identify these pathways,
	expression data over time are required. Dynamic Bayesian network
	(DBN) is an important approach for predicting the gene regulatory
	networks from time course expression data. However, two fundamental
	problems greatly reduce the effectiveness of current DBN methods.
	The first problem is the relatively low accuracy of prediction, and
	the second is the excessive computational time. Results: In this
	paper, we present a DBN-based approach with increased accuracy and
	reduced computational time compared with existing DBN methods. Unlike
	previous methods, our approach limits potential regulators to those
	genes with either earlier or simultaneous expression changes (up-
	or down-regulation) in relation to their target genes. This allows
	us to limit the number of potential regulators and consequently reduce
	the search space. Furthermore, we use the time difference between
	the initial change in the expression of a given regulator gene and
	its potential target gene to estimate the transcriptional time lag
	between these two genes. This method of time lag estimation increases
	the accuracy of predicting gene regulatory networks. Our approach
	is evaluated using time-series expression data measured during the
	yeast cell cycle. The results demonstrate that this approach can
	predict regulatory networks with significantly improved accuracy
	and reduced computational time compared with existing DBN approaches.

	abstract = {Systematic chromatin immunoprecipitation (chIP-chip) experiments have become a central technique for mapping transcriptional interactions in model organisms and humans. However, measurement of chromatin binding does not necessarily imply regulation, and binding may be difficult to detect if it is condition or co-factor dependent. To address these challenges, we present an approach for reliably assigning transcription factors (TFs) to target genes that integrates many lines of direct and indirect evidence into a single probabilistic model. Using this approach, we analyze publicly available chIP-chip binding profiles measured for yeast TFs in standard conditions, showing that our model interprets these data with significantly higher accuracy than previous methods. Pooling the high-confidence interactions reveals a large network containing 363 significant sets of factors (TF modules) that cooperate to regulate common target genes. In addition, the method predicts 980 novel binding interactions with high confidence that are likely to occur in so-far untested conditions. Indeed, using new chIP-chip experiments we show that predicted interactions for the factors Rpn4 and Pdr1 are observed only after treatment of cells with methyl-methanesulfonate, a DNA-damaging agent. We outline the first approach for consistently integrating all available evidences for TF - target interactions and we comprehensively identify the resulting TF module hierarchy. Prioritizing experimental conditions for each factor will be especially important as increasing numbers of chIP-chip assays are performed in complex organisms such as humans, for which standard conditions are ill-defined.},

@article{yang02normalization,

The term normalization refers to the process of removing such variation. A constant adjustment is often used to force the distribution of the intensity log ratios to have a median of zero for each slide. However, such global normalization approaches are not adequate in situations where dye biases can depend on spot overall intensity and/or spatial location within the array. This article proposes normalization methods that are based on robust local regression and account for intensity and spatial dependence in dye biases for different types of cDNA microarray experiments. The selection of appropriate controls for normalization is discussed and a novel set of controls (microarray sample pool, MSP) is introduced to aid in intensity-dependent normalization. Lastly, to allow for comparisons of expression levels across slides, a robust method based on maximum likelihood estimation is proposed to adjust for scale differences among slides.},

Methods: The review considers methods of microarray data collection, transformation and representation, comparisons and predictions of gene expression from the data, their mechanistic analysis, related systems biology, and the application of clustering techniques. Results: Functional genomics approaches have greatly increased the rate at which data on biological systems is generated, leading to corresponding challenges in analyzing the data through advanced computational techniques. The paper compares and contrasts the application of computational clustering for discovery, comparison, and prediction of gene expression classes, together with their evaluation and relation to mechanistic analyses of biological systems. Conclusion: Methods for assaying gene expression levels by DNA microarray experiments produce considerably more data than other techniques, and require a wide variety of computational techniques for identifying patterns of expression that may be biologically significant. These will have to be verified and validated by comparison to results from other methods, integrated with other systems data, and provide the feedback for further experimentation for testing mechanistic or other biological hypotheses.},

abstract = {The functioning of even a simple biological system is much more complicated than the sum of its genes, proteins and metabolites. A premise of systems biology is that molecular profiling will facilitate the discovery and characterization of important disease pathways. However, as multiple levels of effector pathway regulation appear to be the norm rather than the exception, a significant challenge presented by high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies is the extraction of the biological implications of complex data. Thus, integration of heterogeneous types of data generated from diverse global technology platforms represents the first challenge in developing the necessary foundational databases needed for predictive modelling of cell and tissue responses. Given the apparent difficulty in defining the correspondence between gene expression and protein abundance measured in several systems to date, how do we make sense of these data and design the next experiment? In this review, we highlight current approaches and challenges associated with integration and analysis of heterogeneous data sets, focusing on global analysis obtained from high-throughput technologies.

Insights into the perturbative effects on genes involved in respiration, energy generation, and protein synthesis were obtained that would not have been apparent from measurements made at either the messenger RNA or protein level alone, illustrating the power of integrating different types of data obtained from the same sample for the comprehensive characterization of biological systems and processes.

The Gene Ontology (GO) project seeks to provide a set of structured vocabularies for specific biological domains that can be used to describe gene products in any organism. This work includes building three extensive ontologies to describe molecular function, biological process, and cellular component, and providing a community database resource that supports the use of these ontologies. The GO Consortium was initiated by scientists associated with three model organism databases: SGD, the Saccharomyces Genome database; FlyBase, the Drosophila genome database; and MGD/GXD, the Mouse Genome Informatics databases. Additional model organism database groups are joining the project. Each of these model organism information systems is annotating genes and gene products using GO vocabulary terms and incorporating these annotations into their respective model organism databases. Each database contributes its annotation files to a shared GO data resource accessible to the public at http://www.geneontology.org/. The GO site can be used by the community both to recover the GO vocabularies and to access the annotated gene product data sets from the model organism databases. The GO Consortium supports the development of the GO database resource and provides tools enabling curators and researchers to query and manipulate the vocabularies. We believe that the shared development of this molecular annotation resource will contribute to the unification of biological information.},

This database is a repository of 12 346 regulatory associations between transcription factors and target genes, based on experimental evidence which was spread throughout 861 bibliographic references. It also includes 257 specific DNA-binding sites for more than a hundred characterized transcription factors. Further information about each yeast gene included in the database was obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), Regulatory Sequences Analysis Tools and Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium. Computational tools are also provided to facilitate the exploitation of the gathered data when solving a number of biological questions as exemplified in the Tutorial also available on the system. YEASTRACT allows the identification of documented or potential transcription regulators of a given gene and of documented or potential regulons for each transcription factor. It also renders possible the comparison between DNA motifs, such as those found to be over-represented in the promoter regions of co-regulated genes, and the transcription factor-binding sites described in the literature. The system also provides an useful mechanism for grouping a list of genes (for instance a set of genes with similar expression profiles as revealed by microarray analysis) based on their regulatory associations with known transcription factors.

abstract = {Motivation: A central step in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification of groups of genes that exhibit similar expression patterns. Clustering gene expression data into homogeneous groups was shown to be instrumental in functional annotation, tissue classification, regulatory motif identification, and other applications. Although there is a rich literature on clustering algorithms for gene expression analysis, very few works addressed the systematic comparison and evaluation of clustering results. Typically, different clustering algorithms yield different clustering solutions on the same data, and there is no agreed upon guideline for choosing among them.  Results: We developed a novel statistically based method for assessing a clustering solution according to prior biological knowledge. Our method can be used to compare different clustering solutions or to optimize the parameters of a clustering algorithm. The method is based on projecting vectors of biological attributes of the clustered elements onto the real line, such that the ratio of between-groups and within-group variance estimators is maximized. The projected data are then scored using a non-parametric analysis of variance test, and the score's confidence is evaluated. We validate our approach using simulated data and show that our scoring method outperforms several extant methods, including the separation to homogeneity ratio and the silhouette measure. We apply our method to evaluate results of several clustering methods on yeast cell-cycle gene expression data.  Availability: The software is available from the authors upon request.

abstract = {Recently, a variety of clustering algorithms have been proposed to handle data that is not linearly separable. Spectral clustering and kernel k-means are two such methods that are seemingly quite different. In this paper, we show that a general weighted kernel k-means objective is mathematically equivalent to a weighted graph partitioning objective. Special cases of this graph partitioning objective include ratio cut, normalized cut and ratio association. Our equivalence has important consequences: the weighted kernel k-means algorithm may be used to directly optimize the graph partitioning objectives, and conversely, spectral methods may be used to optimize the weighted kernel k-means objective. Hence, in cases where eigenvector computation is prohibitive, we eliminate the need for any eigenvector computation for graph partitioning. Moreover, we show that the Kernighan-Lin objective can also be incorporated into our framework, leading to an incremental weighted kernel k-means algorithm for local optim ization of the objective. We further discuss the issue of convergence of weighted kernel k-means for an arbitrary graph affinity matrix and provide a number of experimental results. These results show that non-spectral methods for graph partitioning are as effective as spectral methods and can be used for problems such as image segmentation in addition to data clustering. },

	abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge; and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e.; it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory; it is found that the usual computational rules; starting with the determination of the partition function; are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting subjective statistical mechanics the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument; and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment; they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available. 
 It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity; metric transitivity; equal  a priori  probabilities; etc.). Furthermore; it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

abstract = {Motivation: Because co-expressed genes are likely to share the same biological function, cluster analysis of gene expression profiles has been applied for gene function discovery. Most existing clustering methods ignore known gene functions in the process of clustering.  Results: To take advantage of accumulating gene functional annotations, we propose incorporating known gene functions into a new distance metric, which shrinks a gene expression-based distance towards 0 if and only if the two genes share a common gene function. A two-step procedure is used. First, the shrinkage distance metric is used in any distance-based clustering method, e.g. K-medoids or hierarchical clustering, to cluster the genes with known functions. Second, while keeping the clustering results from the first step for the genes with known functions, the expression-based distance metric is used to cluster the remaining genes of unknown function, assigning each of them to either one of the clusters obtained in the first step or some new clusters. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction for the yeast demonstrate the advantage of our proposal over the standard method.  Contact: weip@biostat.umn.edu

abstract = {Genomic sequencing is no longer a novelty, but gene function annotation remains a key challenge in modern biology. A variety of functional genomics experimental techniques are available, from classic methods such as affinity precipitation to advanced high-throughput techniques such as gene expression microarrays. In the future, more disparate methods will be developed, further  increasing the need for integrated computational analysis of data generated by these studies. We address this problem with MAGIC (Multisource Association of Genes by Integration of Clusters), a general framework that uses formal Bayesian reasoning to integrate heterogeneous types of high-throughput biological data (such as large-scale two-hybrid screens and multiple microarray analyses) for accurate gene function prediction. The system formally incorporates expert knowledge about relative accuracies of data sources to combine them within a normative framework. MAGIC provides a belief level with its output that allows the user to vary the stringency of predictions. We applied MAGIC to Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic and physical interactions, microarray, and transcription factor binding sites data and assessed the biological relevance of gene groupings using Gene Ontology annotations produced by the Saccaromyces Genome Database. We found that by creating functional groupings based on heterogeneous data types, MAGIC improved accuracy of the groupings compared with microarray analysis alone. We describe several of the biological gene groupings identified.

	abstract = {A system of cluster analysis for genome-wide expression data from DNA microarray hybridization is described that uses standard statistical algorithms to arrange genes according to similarity in pattern of gene expression. The output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that clustering gene expression data groups together efficiently genes of known similar function, and we find a similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. Also, coexpression of genes of known function with poorly characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means of gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which information is not available currently.},

The use of this additional information promises to improve exploratory analysis considerably. RESULTS: We propose constructing a distance function which combines information from expression data and biological networks. Based on this function, we compute a joint clustering of genes and vertices of the network. This general approach is elaborated for metabolic networks. We define a graph distance function on such networks and combine it with a correlation-based distance function for gene expression measurements. A hierarchical clustering and an associated statistical measure is computed to arrive at a reasonable number of clusters. Our method is validated using expression data of the yeast diauxic shift. The resulting clusters are easily interpretable in terms of the biochemical network and the gene expression data and suggest that our method is able to automatically identify processes that are relevant under the measured conditions.},

abstract = {We compare several commonly used expression-based gene clustering algorithms using a figure of merit based on the mutual information between cluster membership and known gene attributes. By studying various publicly available expression data sets we conclude that enrichment of clusters for biological function is, in general, highest at rather low cluster numbers. As a measure of dissimilarity between the expression patterns of two genes, no method outperforms Euclidean distance for ratio-based measurements, or Pearson distance for non-ratio-based measurements at the optimal choice of cluster number. We show the self-organized-map approach to be best for both measurement types at higher numbers of clusters. Clusters of genes derived from single- and average-linkage hierarchical clustering tend to produce worse-than-random results.[The algorithm described is available at http://llama.med.harvard.edu, under Software.]

We report the use of novel tools for both visualization and data set comparison to analyze yeast gene-expression (cell cycle and exit from stationary phase/G(0)) and protein-interaction studies. This analysis led to new insights about each data set. For example, G(1)-regulated genes are not co-regulated during exit from stationary phase, indicating that the cells are not synchronized. The tight clustering of other genes during exit from stationary-phase data set further indicates the physiological responses during G(0) exit are separable from cell-cycle events. Comparison of the two data sets showed that ribosomal-protein genes cluster tightly during exit from stationary phase, but are found in three significantly different clusters in the cell-cycle data set. Two protein-interaction data sets were also compared with the gene-expression data. Visual analysis of the complete data sets showed no clear correlation between co-expression of genes and protein interactions, in contrast to published reports examining subsets of the protein-interaction data. Neither two-hybrid study identified a large number of interactions between ribosomal proteins, consistent with recent structural data, indicating that for both data sets, the identification of false-positive interactions may be lower than previously thought.},

The results show significant differences within and between data sets and emphasize the requirement for additional verification of high-throughput-generated data.

Approch:Two general approaches for determining mRNA coexpression of protein pairs are depicted. In the first approach (I), coexpression is determined by calculating the distance measure and retrieving this from a distance matrix. In the second general approach (II), the distance matrix is used for ensuing clustering. In this case, the degree of coexpression is based on the ultrametric distance of the derived dendogram. Variations of both approaches were tested by applying different distance measures and hierarchical clustering algorithms(unweighted pair-group method average linkage, weighted pair-group method average linkage, complete linkage, and single linkage). For further analysis, a cosine correlation distance only approach has been used for the different protein interaction datasets},

<p>The detailed positions of nucleosomes along genomes have critical roles in transcriptional regulation. Consequently, it is important to understand the principles that govern the organization of nucleosomes in vivo and the functional consequences of this organization. Here we report on progress in identifying the functional consequences of nucleosome organization, in understanding the way in which nucleosome organization is encoded in the DNA, and in linking the two, by suggesting that distinct transcriptional behaviors are encoded through the genome's intrinsic nucleosome organization. Our results thus provide insight on the broader question of understanding how transcriptional programs are encoded in the DNA sequence. These new insights were enabled by individually sequencing ∼380,000 nucleosomes from yeast in their entirety. Using this map, we refine our previous model for predicting nucleosome positions and demonstrate that our new model predicts nucleosome organizations in yeast with high accuracy and that its nucleosome positioning signals are predictive across eukaryotes. We show that the yeast genome may utilize these nucleosome positioning signals to encode regions with both relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) chromatin organizations and relatively closed (nucleosome-covered) chromatin organizations and that this encoding can partly explain aspects of transcription factor binding, gene expression, transcriptional noise, and DNA replication.</p>

@article{kaplan2008nucleosome,
	abstract = {Nucleosome organization is critical for gene regulation. In living cells this organization is determined by multiple factors, including the action of chromatin remodellers, competition with site-specific DNA-binding proteins, and the DNA sequence preferences of the nucleosomes themselves. However, it has been difficult to estimate the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in vivo, because in vivo nucleosome maps reflect the combined action of all influencing factors. Here we determine the importance of nucleosome DNA sequence preferences experimentally by measuring the genome-wide occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA. The resulting map, in which nucleosome occupancy is governed only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes, is similar to in vivo nucleosome maps generated in three different growth conditions. In vitro, nucleosome depletion is evident at many transcription factor binding sites and around gene start and end sites, indicating that nucleosome depletion at these sites in vivo is partly encoded in the genome. We confirm these results with a micrococcal nuclease-independent experiment that measures the relative affinity of nucleosomes for <40,000 double-stranded 150-base-pair oligonucleotides. Using our in vitro data, we devise a computational model of nucleosome sequence preferences that is significantly correlated with in vivo nucleosome occupancy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that the intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes have a central role in determining the organization of nucleosomes in vivo.},

    abstract = {<p>Complex regulatory networks control the transcription state of a genome. These transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) have been mathematically described using a Boolean formalism, in which the state of a gene is represented as either transcribed or not transcribed in response to regulatory signals. The Boolean formalism results in a series of regulatory rules for the individual genes of a TRN that in turn can be used to link environmental cues to the transcription state of a genome, thereby forming a complete transcriptional regulatory system (TRS). Herein, we develop a formalism that represents such a set of regulatory rules in a matrix form. Matrix formalism allows for the systemic characterization of the properties of a TRS and facilitates the computation of the transcriptional state of the genome under any given set of environmental conditions. Additionally, it provides a means to incorporate mechanistic detail of a TRS as it becomes available. In this study, the regulatory network matrix, <bold>R</bold>, for a prototypic TRS is characterized and the fundamental subspaces of this matrix are described. We illustrate how the matrix representation of a TRS coupled with its environment (<bold>R*</bold>) allows for a sampling of all possible expression states of a given network, and furthermore, how the fundamental subspaces of the matrix provide a way to study key TRS features and may assist in experimental design.</p>},

@article{kluger2003spectral,
	abstract = {Global analyses of RNA expression levels are useful for classifying genes and overall phenotypes. Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find "marker genes" that are differentially expressed in particular sets of "conditions." We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive "checkerboard" patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).},

@inproceedings{xing2003metric,
	abstract = {Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar. ” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in ¢¤ {\pounds} , learns a distance metric over ¢¥ {\pounds} that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to significantly improve clustering performance. 1},

@article{sonnenburg2006largescale,
	abstract = {While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often
desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel
matrices for classification, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We
show that it can be rewritten as a semi-infinite linear program that can be efficiently solved by recy-
cling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method
to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classification. Experimental re-
sults show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of
kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of
the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially
when used with sparse feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel
SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multi-
ple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox SHOGUN for which the source code is publicly
available at http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/projects/shogun.},
